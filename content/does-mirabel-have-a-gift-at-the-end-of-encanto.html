        <p>By rachel johnson published feb 02, 2022 in encanto, mirabel is the lone madrigal who isn’t magical. Mirabel does have a gift encanto centers on mirabel, the only madrigal child who didn&#039;t get a magical gift. Though encanto makes it look like mirabel gets snubbed during her gift ceremony in casita, the character may have secretly had a gift all along. It leaves her feeling like an outcast and unwanted, especially when people like her abuela or. Isabela&#039;s room is full of flowers, for example, and antonio&#039;s room fits an entire jungle.</p>
