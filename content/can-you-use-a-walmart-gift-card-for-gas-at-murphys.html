        <p>I just returned something at walmart with no reciept so they gave me a walmart gift card. And if you use your card for gas anywhere else ‚Äúyou can indeed purchase gas using a wal mart gift card, but you can only do it at wal mart gas stations. Here&#039;s the fastest way to get cash for gift cards: Walmart gift cards and egift cards can be used at walmart stores, on walmart.com, at walmart and sam‚Äôs club gas stations, in sam‚Äôs club stores, at samsclub.com and on vudu.com if the gift card user is not a sam‚Äôs club member, a 10 percent surcharge will be added to all purchases. And if you have the capital one walmart rewards¬Æ mastercard¬Æ, you can use it to buy gas at any station.</p>
