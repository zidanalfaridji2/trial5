Though encanto makes it look like mirabel gets snubbed during her gift ceremony in casita, the character may have secretly had a gift all along. But since mirabel didn&#039;t get a gift when she was expected to, she doesn&#039;t have a door. It turns out that she did not get skipped over when it came to the miraculous gifts of the madrigal family, but is, in fact, the gift itself.while she doesn’t have any tangible abilities, mirabel’s special power is love and her ability to bring the family back together allows the magic to come back.</p>

        <p>What does the ending of encanto mean? Why mirabel didn’t get a gift. The last triplet obviously has a mood that could change as fast as the weather. The candle come to life under abuela and also mirabel. Things are different, better, now.</p>
