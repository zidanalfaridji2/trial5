        <p>Any amount god helps you to give today is so appreciated as we kick off this year’s matching gift challenge and will go further to bless people like isaac’s family. They employ over 70 haitians and pay a wage 3 times minimum wage. Please note these platforms are linked to the hope house haiti (uk) account so donations are in gbp. I am so very proud of these photos, and if i was the only person who ever looked at them, that would be just fine with me. Donate to hope for haiti today and your generous gift will help alleviate poverty and improve the lives.</p>
