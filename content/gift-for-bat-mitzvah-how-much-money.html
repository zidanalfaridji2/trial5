        <p>So, if you are having a hard time to decide what to bring or how much to bring to the bar mitzvah boy or bat mitzvah girl, you should consider the following: Therefore, according to tradition, checks or gift tokens for £11 or in multiples of 18 will pass good luck onto the bar mitzvah boy. Essentially, you’re blessing the young boy/girl through a long &amp; successful life. Instead of offering $50, provide $54. Should you give money — and how much?</p>

        <p>A bar mitzvah and also bat mitzvah are among the most vital events in a jewish boy or girl’s life. The amount given per child should be between two or four chai. A general rule for bar or bat mitzvah gift giving is to take the amount you would normally spend on a birthday present and give 1.5 times that amount, in a multiple of 18. You could give each of them $18, or $36, or any other amount. As you decide how much money to give the bar mitzvah boy, consider the number 18.</p>
