        <p>The irs allows a person to give away up to $12.06 million (up from $11.7 million in 2021) in assets or property over the course of their lifetime. This also means that an individual or married couple can gift this same amount during their lifetime and not incur a federal gift tax. The $30,000 per married couple gift limit comes into play when the gift comes from one spouse&#039;s bank account but is from the couple. Married couples potentially can exclude twice that amount, or $24,120,000. In november 2021, the irs announced the revised federal estate tax and gift tax limits for 2022.</p>

        <p>If a gift exceeds the annual $15,000 limit, that does not automatically trigger the gift tax. For 2022, the annual exclusion is $16,000. Even then, it might only trigger. For example, carol and jim are married. You don’t actually owe gift tax until you exceed the lifetime exclusion, which is $12.06 million in 2022.</p>

        <p>You give your three children $20,000 each in 2022, for a total gift of $60,000. Carol gives $20,000 to her daughter janet. No one has any clue as to what the annual gift tax exclusion (or lifetime limit) will be in the 2022 tax year. The federal gift tax limit will jump from $15,000 in 2021 (in effect since 2018), to $16,000 in 2022. See here for the site’s reposting policy.</p>
