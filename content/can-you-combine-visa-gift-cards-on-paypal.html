        <p>Did you know that you can add visa, american express, mastercard or discover gift cards to your paypal account? Use your prepaid gift cards wherever paypal is accepted.

Yes, you can actually use these general purpose gift cards during checkout, as you could with any other debit or credit card that you have on your paypal account. As well, you can always use the visa gift card balance to fund your transactions whenever necessary.</p>
