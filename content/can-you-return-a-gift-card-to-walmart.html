        <p>Some businesses will refund the purchase and give you store. In fact, this also applies to lost money. …if you have one of these, it will clearly state on the front “this gift card cannot be used to purchase tobacco”. Alternatively, you can accept a refund by gift card. I once purchased a can of dog food from walmart.</p>
