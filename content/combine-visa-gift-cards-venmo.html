        <p>Apps, websites, gift card exchange kiosks, and friends. Level 1 · 1 mo. I don&#039;t have a credit card but have these 2 x $75 each prepaid visa credit cards so i thought i might as well use those. When i get those visa gift cards i pay my car insurance with them. So now i&#039;m looking to combine the 2 cards into a $150 prepaid visa card.</p>
